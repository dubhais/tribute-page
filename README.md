I completed this project on 4 July 2022 - Independence Day! What an 
interesting journey, which got me to follow an introduction to how the 
internet works, how to set up files on my system and the best ways to use 
Git and GitHub for project management. I also followed a small portion of the 
lessons in the excellent Free Code Camp and played the educational games 
Line Commander Game and OhMyGit to reinforce what I had learned. 

For this final project I benefitted from the following resources:

# cloning GitHub repositories 
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

# deploying your site using github Pages

Follow the guide 
at https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

(make sure that the deployed branch is `main` in settings)

I also used this guide to using Git with tokens rather than passwords:
